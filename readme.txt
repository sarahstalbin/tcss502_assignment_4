Time took to complete the assignment: approximately 10 hours

I worked on Shape and its Child classes(Circle, Rectangle,Square,Triangle) and its unit test, UML diagram for Shape class

The challenges are to work on the getter property and to initilaise it on every child classes. The str function for draw method didn't work initially later it was tackled. It was quite challenging in the beginning to figure out the ABC concept after some research I was able to understand the concept and work on the program.
